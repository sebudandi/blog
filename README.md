Followed a tutorial from 
https://blog.jcharistech.com/2020/05/21/build-a-simple-crud-blog-with-streamlit-and-python/

ou can see
I used professors script to insert tweets into database .

Since i wasn't able to sucessful extract my own tweet data , i used the cleaned tweets provided in class 
i used the proffsessors codes. 


i changed the UI for streamlite as you can see in the attached screenshot. 



My aim was to understand how to use streamlit with mysql  changing the Profs UI  to the UI i saw in the above video.

Hope this can count for the exercise.
